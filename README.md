# Audio Linked Lava Lamp Shader

This is a modified version of [normalizedcrow's lava lamp shader](https://github.com/normalizedcrow/LavaLamp/) that adds AudioLink functionality. This repository also includes edits done by Torinyan to better fit the design of their Routa avatar.

[You can see the Routa avatar here.](https://booth.pm/en/items/6243300)

The Audiolink shader edit was specifically designed with the Routa avatar, but can work with other things.

This repository also includes some animations for Routa and Routa 5G "Thicc" as well as a new `RoutaALInstructions.pdf` which should make the  install process a tad more smooth.
